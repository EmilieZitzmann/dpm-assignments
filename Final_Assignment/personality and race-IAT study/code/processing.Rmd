# Demographics

Study participants had the option to provide their age and gender, although this was optional, meaning that missing data is not considered an exclusion criterion in this context. 


## Extraction of Age and Gender
Age and Gender should be extracted from the data frame. As these are both within "variable" we have to create two new variables by using pivot_wider. Beforehand we filter out people that were not assigned an individual_id as it makes no sense including data of unidentifiable subjects. Values other than the specified ones are set to "other/missing/error" in order to exclude them only at a later point, if needed. 

```{r}

dat_age_gender <- data_raw_demographics |>
  select(unique_id, variable, response) |>
  filter(!is.na(unique_id)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
              values_from = response,
              values_fill = list(response = "other/missing/error")) |> #in case the specified has missing                                                                           entries
  rename(gender = sex) |>
  mutate(gender = case_when( gender %in% c("f", "m") ~ gender, #returns current value for gender if TRUE
                             is.na(gender) ~ "other/missing/error", #if gender equals NA
                             TRUE ~ "other/missing/error"), #if none of the set conditions is true 
         age = case_when(str_detect(age, "^[0-9]+$") ~ age, #setting the wanted value for age = number
                         is.na(age) ~ "other/missing/error",#if age equals NA
                         TRUE ~ "other/missing/error")) #if none of the other conditions is true
  


#Things from before I might still need 

dat_check_id <- data_raw_demographics |>
  select(unique_id, variable, response) |>
  mutate(missing_Id = ifelse (is.na(unique_id), "missing", "okay")) |>
  group_by(unique_id) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
              values_from = response) |>
  rename(Gender = sex) 

dat_check_id |> 
  filter(unique_id == "missing") |> 
  kable() |> 
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)


#Relabel "sex" to Gender
dat_age_gender <- dat_age_gender 
row.names(dat_age_gender)[2] <- "Gender"

#Relabel "age" to Age
dat_age_gender <- dat_age_gender 
row.names(dat_age_gender)[1] <- "Age"


# Extract Gender and Age
Gender <- dat_age_gender["Gender", , drop = F] #if we put drop = F the result will remain a dataframe
Age <- dat_age_gender["Age", , drop = F]

# Print the result
view(Gender)
view(Age)


```



#BFI 

As part of the study, each respondent was asked to complete between two and three subscales of the Big 5 personality inventory.



## Reverse Score negatively worded items

Specific items were worded negatively. These items need to be reversed in order to be suitable for analysis. This applies to the items: 

•	the extroversion scale items 2, 5 and 7 
  (bfi_e2, bfi_e5, bfi_e7)
•	conscientiousness items 2, 4, 5 and 9
  (bfi_c2, bfi_c4, bfi_c5, bfi_c9)
•	neuroticism items 2, 5, and 7
  (bfi_n2, bfi_n5, bfi_n7)
•	agreeableness 1, 3, 6, and 8, and 
  (bfi_a1, bfi_a3, bfi_a6, bfi_a8)
•	openness items 7 and 9
  (bfi_o7, bfi_o9)

Each value can reach a maximum of 6 and a minimum of 1. In order to return the Items we must remember that the reverted scale is behaving inversely to the positive one so 1 = 6, 2 =5, 3=4, 4=3, 2= 5, 6=1. 
The easiest way to revert a Scale is  to add 1 to the maximum value in order to subtract the original value from it. This way we get the reversed score value. 

In order to modify the data we take mutate, with across we are able to apply this functions to multiple columns, all of specifices the columns of the vector we created . reprensents the column values and ~7 means that it substracts the column values from 7 

```{r}

vector_reversed_items <- c("bfi_e2","bfi_e5","bfi_e7","bfi_c2","bfi_c4","bfi_c5","bfi_c9","bfi_n2","bfi_n5", "bfi_n7","bfi_a1", "bfi_a3","bfi_a6","bfi_a8","bfi_o7","bfi_o9")


dat_reversed_items <- data_raw_bfi |>
  mutate(across(all_of(vector_reversed_items), ~7 - .))
 

```

###Sanity Check 
To check whether the reversals are likely to be correct a correlation matrix for each variable is created. If the correlation is negative or rather low it could indicate that the reversing was not carried out properly. In order to make sure that the correlation stayed the same the correlation matrix is calculated with the original dataset and compared with the reversed one. As the Big Five tend to be normally distributed the pearson correlation is used to calculate the matrix. The "use" within the correlation function is set to complete.obs, which means that variables who are missing data are not included. This is important considering that the participants only filled out two or three of the subscales which is producing some NA. 

```{r}

#Extroversion
Matrix_extroversion_reversed <- dat_reversed_items |>
  select(starts_with("bfi_e")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")

Matrix_extroversion_original <- data_raw_bfi |>
   select(starts_with("bfi_e")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")


#Conscientiousness 
Matrix_conscient_reversed <- dat_reversed_items |>
  select(starts_with("bfi_c")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")

Matrix_conscient_original <- data_raw_bfi |>
   select(starts_with("bfi_c")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")


#Neuroticism
Matrix_neuroticism_reversed <- dat_reversed_items |>
  select(starts_with("bfi_n")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")

Matrix_neuroticism_original <- data_raw_bfi |>
   select(starts_with("bfi_n")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")


#Agreeableness
Matrix_agreeable_reversed <- dat_reversed_items |>
  select(starts_with("bfi_a")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")

Matrix_agreeable_original <- data_raw_bfi |>
   select(starts_with("bfi_a")) |>
  cor(method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")

Matrix_openness_original <- data_raw_bfi |>

Check that the item level data does not violate the logical minimum and maximum scores (1 to 6). Create an exclusion variable and set participants with impossible data to “exclude”. The columns are selected with c_across and we only select the ones that contain bfi


```{r}

#Defining the vector for maximum and minimum 

logical_min <- 1 
logical_max <- 6

#creating the dataset 
data_logical_number <- data_raw_bfi |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(logical_number = ifelse(any(!is.na(c_across(contains("bfi"))) & #selected values are not NA
                                     (c_across(contains("bfi")) < logical_min | 
                                      c_across(contains("bfi")) > logical_max)),
                                 "exclude",
                                 "include"))
```



# Exclusions / data quality

## AMP

```{r}

data_amp_performance_criteria <- data_amp_raw |>

         trialcode != "instructions") |> 
  mutate(latency_prob = if_else(latency < 100, TRUE, FALSE)) |> 
  group_by(subject) |> 
  summarize(proportion_fast_trials_amp = mean(latency_prob)) |>
  mutate(exclude_amp_performance = ifelse(proportion_fast_trials_amp > 0.10, "exclude", "include"))

# determine modal number of trials

  mutate(exclude_amp_completeness = ifelse(n == 72, "include", "exclude")) |>
  select(-n)

# data_amp_completeness |>
#   count(n)

```

- One participant with 8 trials appears to be a partial completion (check raw data?)
- One participant with 144 trials appears to be a repeat participant. I've chosen to exclude them entirely, but you could also have a more elaborate strategy where you retain only their first completion.

# Write to disk

```{r}

# in case this dir doesn't exist, create it
dir.create("../data/processed/")

# save data to disk in that dir
write_csv(data_processed, "../data/processed/data_processed.csv")

```

# Create codebook template for the processed data

If it has not already been created, this code write the codebook template to disk. 

\TODO The template should then be filled in manually with descriptions of each variable so that someone else could understand what these variables represent. 

Be sure to ALWAYS do it, since people forget the labels, the maximum and minimum values etc. We should also specify what they should be (numeric etc.)


I filled out some parts of the codebook but I am not sure whether it is visible on Github:)

```{r}

if(!file.exists("../data/processed/data_processed_codebook.xlsx")){
  # convert the column names to a df
  codebook_template <- data.frame(variable = colnames(data_processed)) |>
    mutate(explanation = NA)
  # write to disk as an excel file
  write.xlsx(codebook_template, file = "../data/processed/data_processed_codebook.xlsx")
}

```

Note that there are other ways of automatically creating more elaborate codebooks from your datasets. These often contain information about min/max/mean/SD, distribution, etc. For example:
